18.Ferromagnetic substances exhibit magnetism even when applied magnetic field is
   removed.

19.Antiferromagnetic substances have no magnetic moment since the electronic spins
   mutually cancel under the influence of external magnetic field.

20.Ferrimagnetic substances exhibit some magnetic character due to alignment of the
   electron spins in parallel and antiparallel directions in unequal numbers.
