5. Coulomb’s Law: The mutual electrostatic force between two point
   charges q1 and q2 is proportional to the product q1q2 and inversely
   proportional to the square of the distance r separating them.
   Mathematically,
    
     F = force on q2 due to q1 = k(q1q2)/rý
     
      where k= 1\4ãî is the constant of proportionality.
   
   In SI units, the unit of charge is coulomb. The experimental value of
   the constant î is
     
      î = 8.854e(-12) Cý/N mý

   The approximate value of k is
     
       k = 9e9 N mý/Cý

6. The ratio of electric force and gravitational force between a proton
   and an electron is
    
     keý/GMm ÷ 2.4e39
