(iii) Thin spherical shell of uniform surface charge density @

            E = (1/4γξ) X (q/rύ) ƒ  (r ς R)

            E = 0  (r < R)
     
     where r is the distance of the point from the centre of the shell and R
     the radius of the shell. q is the total charge of the shell: q = 4γRύε.
     
     The electric field outside the shell is as though the total charge is
     concentrated at the centre. The same result is true for a solid sphere
     of uniform volume charge density. The field is zero at all points inside
     the shell.
