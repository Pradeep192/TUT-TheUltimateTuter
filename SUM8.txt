15. Gaussís law: The flux of electric field through any closed surface S is
    1/Ó times the total charge enclosed by S. The law is especially useful
    in determining electric field E, when the source distribution has simple
    symmetry:
    
    (i) Thin infinitely long straight wire of uniform linear charge density,(lambda)

            E = (1/4„Ó) X (2 x lambda/r) É
  
     where r is the perpendicular distance of the point from the wire and
     É is the radial unit vector in the plane normal to the wire passing
     through the point.

    (ii) Infinite thin plane sheet of uniform surface charge density Â

            E = Â/2Ó É

     where É is a unit vector normal to the plane, outward on either side.
