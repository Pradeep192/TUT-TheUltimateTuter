14. The flux í of electric field E through a small area element S is
    given by

      í = E.S 
   
    The vector area element S is
   
      S = S ƒ 

    where S is the magnitude of the area element and ƒ is normal to the
    area element, which can be considered planar for sufficiently small S.

   For an area element of a closed surface, ƒ is taken to be the direction
   of outward normal, by convention.
