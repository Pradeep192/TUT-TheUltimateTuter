1.Solids have definite mass, volume and shape due to the fixed position of their
  constituent particles.

2.Amorphous and crystalline are two types of solids.

3.On the basis of interaction between constituent particles, crystalline solids are divided into four categories: ionic,molecular,metallic and covalent solids.

4.The three dimensional arrangement of constituents or points in a crystalline  solid is called crystal lattice.

5.The smallest repeating pattern of the crystal lattice is known as unit cell.
  A unit cell is characterised by six parameters: edges a,b,c and angles alpha,
  beta and gama.

6.Number of lattice points or atoms in simple cubic unit cell is 1.
