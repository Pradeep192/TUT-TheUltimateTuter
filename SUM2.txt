4. Electric charge has three basic properties: quantisation, additivity
   and conservation.
    
     Quantisation of electric charge means that total charge (q) of a body
   is always an integral multiple of a basic quantum of charge (e) i.e.,
   q = n e, where n = 0, ñ1, ñ2, ñ3, .... Proton and electron have charges
   +e, -e, respectively. For macroscopic charges for which n is a very large
   number, quantisation of charge can be ignored.
     
     Additivity of electric charges means that the total charge of a system
   is the algebraic sum (i.e., the sum taking into account proper signs)
   of all individual charges in the system.
     
     Conservation of electric charges means that the total charge of an
   isolated system remains unchanged with time. This means that when
   bodies are charged through friction, there is a transfer of electric charge
   from one body to another, but no creation or destruction of charge.
