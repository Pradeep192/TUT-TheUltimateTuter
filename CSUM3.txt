12.Packing efficiency for 
	(a) hcp and ccp structure = 74%
	(b) body centered = 68%
	(c) simple cubic lattice = 52.4%

13.Imperfections in solids are electronic or point deffects.

14.Semiconductors are of two types : n-type and p-type.

15.n-type semiconductors are formed by adding small amounts of elements of group 15
   to the pure elements of group 14 such as Si and Ge.

16.p-type semiconductors are formed by adding small amounts of elements of group 13
   to the pure elements of group 14.

17.Paramagnetic substances show magnetic behaviour only under the influence of the
   applied magnetic fields.
