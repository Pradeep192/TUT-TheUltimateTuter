7.A tetrahedral void is formed when spheres are tetrahedrally arranged in space
  while octahedral void is formed by there octahedral arrangement. 

8.Coordination number is the number of neighbouring atoms for an atom in a crystal.
  Coordination number of trigonal planer equals to 3 , tetrahedral equals to 4 ,
  octahedral equals to 6 and body centered is 8.

9.Atomic radii is related to edge length as follows:
         r = a/2 (simple), r = (rt3/4)a (body centered), r = a/2rt2 (face centered).

10.Density(d) of a unit cell can be calculated by:
	      d = (Z x M)/(a^3 x N_a)
   Where, Z = No. of atoms per unit cell 
          M = atomic mass (or molecular mass)
          N_a = Avogadro constant
          a = edge length

11.Packing efficiency is the percentage of total space filled by the particals.
