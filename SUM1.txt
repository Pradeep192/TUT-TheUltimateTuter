1. Electric and magnetic forces determine the properties of atoms,
   molecules and bulk matter.

2. From simple experiments on frictional electricity, one can infer that
   there are two types of charges in nature; and that like charges repel
   and unlike charges attract. By convention, the charge on a glass rod
   rubbed with silk is positive; that on a plastic rod rubbed with fur is
   then negative.

3. Conductors allow movement of electric charge through them, insulators
   do not. In metals, the mobile charges are electrons; in electrolytes
   both positive and negative ions are mobile.
