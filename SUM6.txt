12. Field of an electric dipole in its equatorial plane (i.e., the plane
   perpendicular to its axis and passing through its centre) at a distance
   r from the centre:

        E = (1/4го) X {-p/(aэ+rэ)^3/2}
          
          ч (1/4го) X (-p/r^3) ,  for r >> a   
 
   Dipole electric field on the axis at a distance r from the centre:

        E = (1/4го) X {2pr/(rэ-aэ)э}

          ч (1/4го) X (p/r^3)   for r >> a

   The 1/r^3 dependence of dipole electric fields should be noted in contrast
   to the 1/rэ dependence of electric field due to a point charge.

13. In a uniform electric field E, a dipole experiences a torque в given by
     
       в = p x E
      
      but experiences no net force.
