7. Superposition Principle: The principle is based on the property that the
   forces with which two charges attract or repel each other are not
   affected by the presence of a third (or more) additional charge(s). For
   an assembly of charges q1, q2, q3, ..., the force on any charge, say q1, is
   the vector sum of the force on q1 due to q2, the force on q1 due to q3,
   and so on. For each pair, the force is given by the Coulomb’s law for
   two charges stated earlier.

8. The electric field E at a point due to a charge configuration is the
   force on a small positive test charge q placed at the point divided by
   the magnitude of the charge. Electric field due to a point charge q has
   a magnitude |q|/4ãîrý; it is radially outwards from q, if q is positive,
   and radially inwards if q is negative. Like Coulomb force, electric field
   also satisfies superposition principle.

9. An electric field line is a curve drawn in such a way that the tangent
   at each point on the curve gives the direction of electric field at that
   point. The relative closeness of field lines indicates the relative strength
   of electric field at different points; they crowd near each other in regions
   of strong electric field and are far apart where the electric field is
   weak. In regions of constant electric field, the field lines are uniformly
   spaced parallel straight lines.
